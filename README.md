# SQL-for-COVID19

In this little project we will analyze data about COVID-19 in Mexico.

There two sections in this project: 
* Queries
* Stored Procedures

The data was provided by **Secretar√≠a de Salud** in this link: https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/604001/Datos_abiertos_hist_ricos_2020.pdf

The dataset only contains *1,182,695* records until **August 17, 2020**.
